# Deep Learning Lab Assignments

## Description:

This repository contains code for lab assignments of [Deep Learning course](https://uvadlc.github.io/lectures-sep2018.html#) offered in MSc. in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam.

### Assignemnt 1: MLP backprop, NumPy implementation, Pytorch MLP, Batch Normalization, Pytorch CNN

In this lab, we learn to implement and train basic neural architectures like Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLPs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image classification tasks.
We also implement custom operations in PyTorch; a batch-normalization layer.

#### Problems and solution
* [Main problem statement](https://github.com/druv022/Deep_Learning_Lab/blob/master/assignment_1/assignment_1.pdf), [Python Code](https://github.com/druv022/Deep_Learning_Lab/tree/master/assignment_1/code) and [Report](https://github.com/druv022/Deep_Learning_Lab/blob/master/assignment_1/pujary_assignment1.pdf)

### Assignment 2: Vanilla RNN, LSTM, Modified LSTM Cell, Recurrent Nets as Generative Model

In this lab, we familiarize with Vanilla recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and LSTM on a simple toy problem of Palindrome Numbers. We study more advanced LSTM cell to emphasize the wide variety in LSTM cells. Finally, we use LSTM for learning and generating text.

#### Problems and solution
* [Main problem statement](https://github.com/druv022/Deep_Learning_Lab/blob/master/assignment_2/assignment_2.pdf), [Python Code](https://github.com/druv022/Deep_Learning_Lab/tree/master/assignment_2/code) and [Report](https://github.com/druv022/Deep_Learning_Lab/blob/master/assignment_2/pujary_assignment2.pdf)

### Assignment 3: Variational Auto Encoders and Generative Advesarial Networks

In this lab, we study and implement Deep Generative Models, specifically Variational Auto Encoders ([VAE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114)) and Generative Advesarial Networks ([GAN](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets)).

#### Problems and solution
* [Main problem statement](https://github.com/druv022/Deep_Learning_Lab/blob/master/assignment_3/assignment_3.pdf), [Python Code](https://github.com/druv022/Deep_Learning_Lab/tree/master/assignment_3/code) and [Report](https://github.com/druv022/Deep_Learning_Lab/blob/master/assignment_3/pujary_assignment3.pdf)

### Poster Presentations

We presented Attention is all you Need paper by Vaswani et al. This was done in collaboration with [Vikrant Yadav](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vikrant-yadav-98134496/) and [Tarun Krishna](https://github.com/KrishnaTarun).

The poster can be found [here](https://github.com/druv022/Deep_Learning_Lab/blob/master/Poster/poster.pdf).

# Deep Learning Lab Assignments
---
## Description:
This repository contains code for lab assignments of [Deep Learning course](https://uvadlc.github.io/lectures-sep2018.html#) offered in MSc. in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam.

## Assignemnt 1: MLP backprop, NumPy implementation, Pytorch MLP, Batch Normalization, Pytorch CNN

In this lab, we learn to implement and train basic neural architectures like Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLPs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image classification tasks.
We also implement custom operations in PyTorch; a batch-normalization layer.

## Assignment 2: Vanilla RNN, LSTM, Modified LSTM Cell, Recurrent Nets as Generative Model

In this lab, we familiarize with Vanilla recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and LSTM on a simple toy problem of Palindrome Numbers. We study more advanced LSTM cell to emphasize the wide variety in LSTM cells. Finally, we use LSTM for learning and generating text.

## Assignment 3: Variational Auto Encoders and Generative Advesarial Networks

In this lab, we study and implement Deep Generative Models, specifically Variational Auto Encoders ([VAE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114)) and Generative Advesarial Networks ([GAN](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets)).
